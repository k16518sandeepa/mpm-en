    <p>Hello Guys,</p>
    <p>Today, we're bringing you an article about an underrated series in Sri Lanka: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6226232/" class="link", target="_blank">Young Sheldon</a> (Beyond the Bazinga: A Look at the Heart of Young Sheldon).</p>
    <p>Regarding the story, even if you haven't watched it, if you're a fan of TV series, you've definitely heard of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/" class="life", target="_blank">The Big Bang Theory</a>. Young Sheldon is about the childhood life of Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory. Sheldon Cooper's childhood takes place primarily in the 1980s and 1990s. Sheldon is a child prodigy with a super brain (similar to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212671/" class="link", target="_blank">Malcolm in the Middle</a> from a series we uploaded previously). The series beautifully builds up how Sheldon's unique issues differ from other children's and how he interacts with his family, schoolmates, and others.</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Armitage" class="link", target="_blank">Iain Armitage</a> plays the role of Sheldon. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Perry" class="link", target="_blank">Zoe Perry</a> portrays his mother, who supports Sheldon in all his endeavors. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Barber" class="link", target="_blank">Lance Barber</a> plays the father. Sheldon also has a sister and an older brother, and the way Sheldon interacts with them is presented wonderfully. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raegan_Revord" class="link", target="_blank">Raegan Revord</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana_Jordan" class="link", target="_blank">Montana Jordan</a> play the sister and brother, respectively. Furthermore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Potts" class="link", target="_blank">Annie Potts</a> has a prominent role in the story as Sheldon's grandmother. Even Elon Musk, the CEO of companies like Space X and Tesla, has made an appearance.</p>
    <p>Young Sheldon falls under the genres of Comedy and Sitcom. It was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Lorre" class="link", target="_blank">Chuck Lorre</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Molaro" class="link", target="_blank">Steven Molaro</a> (Chuck Lorre also created The Big Bang Theory). Young Sheldon first premiered on the <a href="https://www.cbs.com/" class="link", target="_blank">CBS Network</a> on September 25, 2017. In terms of ratings, it has an IMDB score of 7.7/10 and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 76%. It ranks 165th on IMDB's popular TV show list. Young Sheldon has also won 8 awards and received 32 nominations.</p>
    <p>So, Guys, to see how Sheldon navigates life with his family, friends, and society, go ahead and download and watch it! We'll meet again with another fantastic series soon.</p>
