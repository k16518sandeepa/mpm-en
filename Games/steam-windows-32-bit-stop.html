    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation" class="link", target="_blank">Valve</a> announced yesterday (September 18th) that they will be discontinuing support for the last 32-bit operating system supported by the Steam platform: Windows 10 32-bit.</p>
    <p>Valve is strongly recommending that users upgrade to the 64-bit version of Windows 10 or later before <strong>January 1, 2026</strong>, to ensure continued access to their favorite games and to prevent technical issues.</p>
    <p>This move by Steam to drop Windows 10 32-bit comes as Microsoft's mainstream support for Windows 10 is scheduled to end on Tuesday, October 14, 2025 (following the launch of Windows 11 in 2021). This end-of-support timeline is a contributing factor to Valve's decision. Regardless, gamers will eventually need to upgrade to Windows 11 to take advantage of new features and support for future PC games, as some titles, like Final Fantasy 14, are ending their own mainline support for Windows 10 on October 14th.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Implications:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Updates</strong>: Effective January 1, 2026, Windows 10 32-bit users will no longer receive any updates for the Steam client, including crucial security updates.</li>
      <li><strong>No Technical Support</strong>: Steam will be unable to guarantee technical support for any issues related to the 32-bit operating system after this date.</li>
      <li><strong>Low User Base</strong>: According to the September <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam" class="link", target="_blank">2025 Steam Hardware Survey</a>, only about 0.01% of the user base is currently running a 32-bit OS.</li>
      <li><strong>Current User Statistics</strong>: The most popular operating system is Windows 11 64-bit, used by 60.39% of Steam users. Windows 10 64-bit is in second place, used by 35.08%.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This step reflects a broader industry shift toward 64-bit computing, which is necessary for core Steam features that rely on system drivers and libraries no longer supported by 32-bit Windows.</p>
