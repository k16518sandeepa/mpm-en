    <p>Hello Guys, Today, we're covering a Top-Rated Animation Series: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/" class="link", target="_blank">Rick and Morty</a>.</p>
    <p>Rick and Morty first premiered in 2013, and by that time, the series had already amassed a huge fanbase. Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon served as the main writers, and the show premiered on Adult Swim on December 2, 2013.</p>
    <p>The story revolves around Rick Sanchez and his grandson, Morty Smith. Rick is a scientist on a different level, though he is also a heavy drinker. Morty is the son of Rick's daughter, Beth. Morty is easily flustered and anxious. The story begins when Rick moves into Beth's house. In addition to Rick and Morty, the story beautifully builds up the rest of Beth's family: Jerry (Morty's father) and Summer (Morty's older sister). Rick and Morty differs from other animations because, like all good comedy, it contains deep, complex, and hidden ideas.</p>
    <p>Rick and Morty belongs to the genres of Sci-Fi, Action, Adventure, Comedy, and Animation. In terms of ratings, it holds an IMDB score of 9.1/10 and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 90%. It is currently ranked 50th on IMDB's popular TV show list and has won over 18 awards and received more than 40 nominations.</p>
    <p>Finally, even if you are someone who doesn't typically like animation series, you should definitely try this one out. It is totally worth it and highly recommended. Alright Guys, we'll meet again with another awesome series soon.</p>
